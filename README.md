# global-ev-sales-powerbi

## Introduction
This Power BI report presents a comprehensive overview of Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales across regions, modes, and powertrain types. It highlights key metrics such as total value, growth trends by year, and regional contributions. The dashboard enables interactive filtering by region, mode, category, and year for deeper insights. Visualizations include time-series trends, powertrain distribution, and top-performing regions in EV adoption.

**OBJECTIVE -** 
To deliver a comprehensive, data-driven view of global Electric Vehicle (EV) trends spanning regional adoption, category performance, powertrain evolution, and time-based growth patterns in order to support strategic decision-making, policy development, and future investment planning in the EV ecosystem

**TOOL USED :**   POWERBI

**DATA SOURCE :** Global EV Data
